# Minnamumi Christmas Calendar

Small christmas calendar built with HTML, CSS & Javascript with JQuery

## Advent Calendar

Recently, I made an online Christmas calendar where the streamer and viewers could open a new door every day in December. I made the website with HTML5, CSS and Javascript with JQuery, where I then hosted the page with Github Pages. Check it out [Here](https://hopex1411.github.io/)

*It only works with monitors running a 1920x1080 resolution, cause the calendar was made for that size frame in OBS
